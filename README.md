## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

> **Note:** If the project uses a database (e.g., MongoDB or SQL), configure the connection first.

   ```

2. **Install dependencies for backend**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start server**

   npm start
   ```

4. **Open frontend**
   Open the `client/index.html` in your browser or serve it with a static host.

## 📌 What I Learned

* Building a **full-stack web application** from scratch
* Connecting **frontend UI** with backend logic
* Structuring scalable projects with separate **client** and **server** modules
* Working with **RESTful routes** and server responses
* Improving UI design using modern HTML/CSS and JavaScript

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* Add **database integration** (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
* Implement **user authentication** (login/signup)
* Add **shopping cart and checkout**
* Deploy the full app (e.g., on Heroku / Vercel / Netlify)
